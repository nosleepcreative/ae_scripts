# Naming Convention Optimized for Motion Graphics
NTPDP_SC01_010
NTPDP_SC01_020
NTPDP_SC02_010
NTPDP_SC02_020
NTPDP_SC03_010
NTPDP_SC03_020
NTPDP_SC03_030
NTPDP_SC04_010

## Requirements
âœ… Scene-based structure (SC01, SC02, etc.)
âœ… Shot numbers increase by 10 for flexibility.
âœ… Short, clean, and easy to manage
âœ… No versioning, as we replaces things, but do archive old versions

## Why This Naming Works for Everyone
ðŸ”¹ Clear Scene & Shot Structure
NTPDP_SC01_010 â†’ Instantly tells you itâ€™s Scene 1, Shot 10
Editors and producers can quickly locate shots without extra explanation.

ðŸ”¹ Logical Numbering for Flexibility
Incrementing by 10 (010, 020, 030) allows space for future shots (e.g., insert a new shot as 015).
Prevents messy renaming or last-minute filename collisions.

ðŸ”¹ Easy for Editors & VFX Teams
Editors can match filenames to the edit timeline without confusion.
If a new team member joins, they can immediately understand the structure
