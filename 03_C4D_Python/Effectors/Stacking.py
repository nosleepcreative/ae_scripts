"""Simple example for an effector that 'stacks' clones by their particle geometry size.

This can get quite complicated when supposed to be done with arbitrary particle transforms where
particles are rotated in odd angles. This is just a naÃ¯ve variant stacking along the y-axis,
assuming all particles to have an orientation of (0, y, 0), i.e., only allowing for rotations around
the stacking axis.

Your code had basically the correct idea, multiply the particle scale by the actual geometry size,
but had some problems in the details.
